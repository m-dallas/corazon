`corazon` is a Python package to run a simple BLS exoplanet search on TESS FFIs.
It retrievs TESS light curves, detrends a light curve,
runs a box-least-squares fit search algorithm and vets the signal using
`exovetter` (https://github.com/spacetelescope/exovetter/).

This package depends on the next yet released (as of Jan 22, 2021) Lightkurve v2.0 (https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve)to allow it to retrieve high-level-science
products from the MAST. It must be locally installed from git to run corazon.

To run corazon on one target do the following:

from corazon import run_pipeline

ticid = 383724012

sector = 14

outdir = "/Users/username/local/directory/to/store/output/"

run_pipeline.run_write_one(ticid, sector, outdir)


If you are getting the data from a local directory, do the followingg
local_dir - "/Users/username/local/directory/of/data/files"

run_pipeline.run_write_one(ticid, sector, outdir, local_dir)
